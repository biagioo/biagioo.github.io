For my Sinatra MVC project, I created an online closet application. This CMS application allows a use to add items into an online closet with a clothing type, brand and size. The relationship between items and users is a has many/belongs to relationship. So an item belongs to a user and a user has many items. I thought this was a great way to meet the requirements the project has.

This morning I was looking over my project and was extremely proud of the application I built. I thought about how 3 months ago I have never coded anything ever and this week I was able to build a fully functional MVC application. I feel like this is a great accomplishment and milestone of my Software Enginer journey that makes me super excited to dive into Rails after this upcoming break!
